I woke up one day, like every other day, but I felt different; somehow changed.

I felt like I needed to write again.

In my past I dabbled in writing: a stint covering competitive DOTA 2 with [Gosu Gamers][gosu-gamers], some culture coverage at a small blog called [Nerd Array][nerd-array](now On Live HQ, long story), and even a personal venture called [The Distractor Blog][the-distractor-blog](cached into an "Old" folder to prevent comment spam).

None of these positions really fulfilled me creatively, even if they had, life and my education were consuming my time too completely for me to dedicate myself to a craft. I had to learn how to make websites and become economically useful. Now that I have graduated and added several skills to my toolbelt I feel that I can begin again.

This site is my new home base, my personal shrine and my lonely island. I hope to sail ships though, to affect some change and contribute to the conversation. I want to do movie/music/video game reviews again, to comment on not just development or design, but culture and the Big Picture at large.

Maybe someone will read it too.

**P.S. -** That raccoon-looking thing in the top-left is no raccoon at all, it is my Spirit Bear. My personal mascot and eternal digital friend.

**P.P.S. -** I promise that I am not mentally ill.
