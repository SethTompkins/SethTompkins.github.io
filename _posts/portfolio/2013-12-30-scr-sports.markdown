Talk about a trip down memory lane.

[SCR Sports][scr-sports] was one of my first full-stack web development experiences. Not only was I tasked with developing and designing an attractive static site, but SCR also wanted a portal through which to sell their professional sports training gear to the masses. I was a little daunted at first, but with some perseverance and determination I was able to craft a secure [Open Cart][open-cart] based shop page and a visually attractive informational site.
