This is the homepage for [Strategexe LLC][strategexe], a great Louisville based marketing agency that is my current place of employment.

I went for a modern and flat design direction with a heavy emphasis on the colors represented in the agency's logo. The logo, the main stock image of the eye, and the [icon set][streamline] I used are the only elements of this site that I did not personally create. The gradient band at the top of the site commands the flow of colors throughout the main page. I would have made the contact form canary yellow but, you know, readability.
