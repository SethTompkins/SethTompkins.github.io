One fateful day my Dad called me and said "Son, can you make me a blog?" I said "Your in luck Dad, that's what I do for a living."

[The Solano Project][the-solano-project] is my Daddy-O's personal blog for all things horse/horse-riding/horse-keeping/horse-play. Basically my parents love and live for their horses, a noble pursuit of loving animals and nature. They enjoy endurance riding and horse enthusiasm of all kinds.

They even have a **MINI-HORSE!**

Trust me, if oyu are interested in horse culture you will find something interesting to read here.

**Work Done: Design, Development, Sick horse head icon**

**CMS: Wordpress**

**Fonts used: Arvo, Open Sans**
