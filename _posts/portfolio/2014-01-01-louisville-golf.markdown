As a disclaimer: I am not a golfer, but I do like watching it.

I can easily relate to the romance of nature and sport, of honing a long game and mastering a skill.

[Louisville Golf][louisville-golf] is a profoundly distinguished gold club manufacturer. Honestly when they came to us at [Strategexe][strategexe] I had no idea who they were nor how important their business really was. After we got to know Mike Just and learned about his company we soon discovered that not only did Tiger Woods call them for a custom putter, their product was also prominently featured in one of the highest grossing films of all time: Avatar.

Needless to say jaws had to be scraped off the floor as soon as we learned that their old site wasn't in need of a stylistic update, it actually **failed to function as an e-commerce platform**. We quickly sprung into action.

I lifted my design inspiration straight from the course itself: green grass and soft brown dirt, the wood of the persimmon shafted drivers Louisville Golf is famous for. In the end the site makes you *feel* like golfing.

Mission accomplished.
